# Handbook_Scrape
This is a summary of my files and components used to web scrape the University of Melbourne handbook to eventually create a course planner.

I am also on the task of creating this website that allows course planning with automatic checking of prerequisites, course/subejct rules and other tasks.

Feeling excited tho
