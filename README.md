# Handbook_Scrape
This is a summary of my files and components used to web scrape the University of Melbourne handbook to eventually create a course planner.

I am also on the task of creating this website that allows course planning with automatic checking of prerequisites, course/subejct rules and other tasks.

Feeling excited tho

To setup dev environment, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and:
* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements`

You can then run the scripts from the virtual environment. To deactivate the virtual environment, just use `deactivate`.
